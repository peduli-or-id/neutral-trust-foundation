# Why No Real Data Is Used

## Design Decision Overview

The absence of real network data is a **deliberate architectural choice**,
not a technical limitation.

---

## Regulatory Rationale

Using real network data would:

- Introduce jurisdictional complexity
- Trigger data protection obligations
- Create unintended regulatory dependencies

Neutral Trust Foundation avoids these risks by design.

---

## Standards Rationale

3GPP focuses on:
- Requirements
- Architecture
- Interoperability

It does not require operational datasets
to validate conceptual gaps or study items.

---

## Scientific Rationale

The objective is to study:

- Whether behavior can be abstracted
- Whether trust can be inferred without access
- Whether neutrality can be preserved

These questions do not require real data.

---

## Risk Mitigation

By excluding real data, the project:

- Eliminates privacy risk
- Eliminates interception concerns
- Eliminates operator liability

---

## Future Considerations

Should real data ever be required, it would only occur:

- In controlled laboratory environments
- With explicit operator consent
- Under formal governance frameworks
- With regulatory awareness

Until then, synthetic data remains sufficient and preferred.
