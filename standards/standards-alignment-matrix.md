# Standards Alignment Matrix
Neutral Trust Foundation (NTF)

---

## Document Status

- Type: Informative Alignment Matrix
- Normative Status: Non-normative
- Purpose: Transparency & interoperability reference
- Audience: Regulators, Operators, Standards Bodies

---

## 1. Scope & Disclaimer

This document describes how the Neutral Trust Foundation (NTF),
Network Behavior Oracle (NBO), and Silent Validator concepts are
**aligned with existing global standards**.

NTF does NOT:
- Claim standards ownership
- Replace any 3GPP, ETSI, or GSMA specification
- Introduce new protocol requirements

This document is **informative only**.

---

## 2. Alignment Philosophy

NTF follows three alignment principles:

1. **Non-intrusive**
2. **Behavior-level abstraction**
3. **Privacy by design**

Alignment is conceptual and architectural, not protocol-binding.

---

## 3. 3GPP Alignment

| 3GPP Area | Relevant Specs | Alignment Description |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Architecture | TS 23-series | NTF operates outside control and user planes |
| Network Management | TS 28-series | Behavior indicators resemble aggregated KPIs |
| Security | TS 33-series | Privacy preservation, no interception |
| Analytics | TS 23.288 (NWDAF) | NTF is complementary, not substitutive |

**Key Note:**  
NTF does not access NWDAF data nor expose NWDAF outputs.

---

## 4. ETSI Alignment

| ETSI Domain | Reference | Alignment |
|------------|----------|----------|
| ZSM | ETSI GS ZSM | Behavior abstraction aligns with intent-based views |
| NFV | ETSI MANO | No orchestration or lifecycle control |
| MEC | ETSI MEC | Edge behavior can be abstracted without data export |

---

## 5. GSMA Alignment

| GSMA Area | Reference | Alignment |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Trust Framework | GSMA Security Principles | Neutral third-party trust |
| Fraud & Assurance | GSMA FASG | Evidence-based assurance |
| Inter-operator trust | GSMA IR | Conceptual trust anchor |

---

## 6. Privacy & Data Protection Alignment

| Framework | Alignment |
|---------|----------|
| GDPR | No personal data, no identifiers |
| ISO/IEC 27701 | Privacy by design |
| OECD Privacy Principles | Purpose limitation |

NTF processes **behavioral abstractions only**.

---

## 7. What NTF Explicitly Does NOT Align With

NTF explicitly avoids alignment with:
- Lawful interception systems
- Active monitoring probes
- Traffic mirroring solutions
- Subscriber analytics platforms

---

## 8. Alignment Summary

| Dimension | Status |
|--------|-------|
| 3GPP Compatibility | Aligned |
| ETSI Compatibility | Aligned |
| GSMA Compatibility | Aligned |
| Privacy Compliance | Strong |
| Operational Intrusion | None |

---

## 9. Future Standardization Path (Informative)

Possible future paths include:
- 3GPP Study Item (informative)
- ETSI ISG contribution
- GSMA discussion paper

All future work will preserve:
- Operator sovereignty
- Neutral governance
- Privacy guarantees

---

## Final Statement

Neutral Trust Foundation is **standards-aligned, not standards-defining**.

This matrix exists to support informed discussion, not mandate adoption.
